# 2024 Report

## **Project Background**

Lynila Pharmacy has recently welcomed a new director whose vision includes improved operational oversight and strategic financial planning. As part of the transition, a historical data review spanning five years (2020–2024) was conducted by the analytics team to understand trends, performance gaps, and opportunities for growth. The focus has now shifted to a detailed analysis of the pharmacy's financials in 2024, which will serve as a foundation for strategic decisions for the fiscal year 2025.

## **Executive Summary**

In 2024, Lynila Pharmacy reported a **total revenue of $0.7 billion** and **total expenses of $131 million**, resulting in a **net income of $0.6 billion**. The year displayed a strong profitability margin with relatively controlled expenditures, especially in the second half. Notably, **prescription sales formed the vast majority of income**, significantly outpacing over-the-counter (OTC) sales. Quarter-by-quarter trends reveal minor fluctuations but overall financial stability, setting a solid foundation for optimized strategies in 2025.

## **Recommendations for 2025**

Based on the 2024 financial performance, Lynila Pharmacy should capitalize on its strong financial performance in 2024—particularly the high profit margins driven by prescription sales and effective cost control—to guide its 2025 strategy. We recommend prioritizing three key initiatives:

1. **Expand Prescription Services**: Continue strengthening core prescription offerings through customer loyalty programs and strategic partnerships with healthcare providers.
2. **Grow OTC Sales**: Leverage the underutilized OTC segment (only 6% of total revenue) by enhancing product variety, optimizing shelf space, and launching targeted promotions.
3. **Maintain Cost Discipline**: Preserve the operational efficiencies that led to reduced expenses in Q3 and Q4 by institutionalizing successful procurement and workforce strategies.
4.  **Focus on Prescription Retention Programs**
- Develop patient loyalty programs or digital prescription refill systems.
- Collaborate with healthcare providers to streamline and grow recurring prescription revenues.

 **5. Invest in Digital and Delivery Services**

- As revenue continues to grow steadily, reinvesting in e-commerce, telepharmacy, or home delivery could further solidify the pharmacy's market position.
